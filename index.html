             <div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p>A town cannot live on dreams. The change was slow but harsh. The young men and women, boys and girls left to find work and to build another life. And the town became, not all at once but steadily, a town of pleasure. People swarmed in on weekends, and they still do. And it will no doubt go on. And there is no blame in this. The town had to find another way to live.</p><footer>﻿Upstream (Mary Oliver)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Previously there were small shops because it was a small town. Now there are small shops because the tourists want to think they are still in that little town, which has vanished. It is good business now to appear antiquated, with narrow aisles and quaintly labeled jars.</p><footer>﻿Upstream (Mary Oliver)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Darkness you are gentler than my lover . . . his flesh was sweaty and panting, I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me. (p. 109)</p><footer>﻿Upstream (Mary Oliver)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Logic and sermons never convince, The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul (p. 56)</p><footer>﻿Upstream (Mary Oliver)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is a simple case. The eye that does not look back does not acknowledge.</p><footer>﻿Upstream (Mary Oliver)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>The most regretful people on earth are those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.</p><footer>﻿Upstream (Mary Oliver)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>The world sheds, in the energetic way of an open and communal place, its many greetings, as a world should. What quarrel can there be with that?</p><footer>﻿Upstream (Mary Oliver)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Adults can change their circumstances; children cannot. Children are powerless, and in difficult situations they are the victims of every sorrow and mischance and rage around them, for children feel all of these things but without any of the ability that adults have to change them. Whatever can take a child beyond such circumstances, therefore, is an alleviation and a blessing.</p><footer>﻿Upstream (Mary Oliver)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>In the beginning I was so young and such a stranger to myself I hardly existed.</p><footer>﻿Upstream (Mary Oliver)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>. . . in solitude, or in that deserted state when we are surrounded by human beings and yet they sympathise not with us, we love the flowers, the grass and the waters and the sky. In the motion of the very leaves of spring in the blue air there is then found a secret correspondence with our heart.</p><footer>﻿Upstream (Mary Oliver)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>'Thou shalt not live under the same heaven nor tread the same earth with the enemy of thy father or lord,'</p><footer>﻿Tales of Old Japan (Lord Redesdale)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>They were grainy things, soot and chalk. They could have been anybody.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>The window reflected the news. It was about power and sports and anger and death.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>But it was too early in the evening for programs that allowed people with peculiar opinions to speak out. It was only a little after eight o’clock, so all the shows were about silliness or murder.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>It was very exciting for her, taking his dignity away in the name of love.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>“It would sound like a dream,” said Billy. “Other people’s dreams aren’t very interesting, usually.”</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>And that thought had a brother: “There are right people to lynch.” Who? People not well connected. So it goes.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>She upset Billy simply by being his mother. She made him feel embarrassed and ungrateful and weak because she had gone to so much trouble to give him life, and to keep that life going, and Billy didn’t really like life at all.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.”</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>There was a soft drink bottle on the windowsill. Its label boasted that it contained no nourishment whatsoever.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past, the present, and the future.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Like so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>The nicest veterans in Schenectady, I thought, the kindest and funniest ones, the ones who hated war the most, were the ones who’d really fought.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>At that time, they were teaching that there was absolutely no difference between anybody. They may be teaching that still.</p><footer>Slaughterhouse-five (Kurt Vonnegut)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Being big is not necessarily a good thing: most organisms are bacteria and very few are elephants.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>'The rabbit runs faster than the fox, because the rabbit is running for his life while the fox is only running for his dinner.'</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>But 'chance' is just a word expressing ignorance. It means 'determined by some as yet unknown, or unspecified, means'.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>When we die there are two things we can leave behind us: genes and memes.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>What is it about the idea of a god that gives it its stability and penetrance in the cultural environment? The survival value of the god meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal. It provides a superficially plausible answer to deep and troubling questions about existence. It suggests that injustices in this world may be rectified in the next. The 'everlasting arms' hold out a cushion against our own inadequacies which, like a doctor's placebo, is none the less effective for being imaginary.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>It may be that the overall probability that a random member of the school is a relation is so high that the altruism is worth the cost.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>parental care is just a special case of kin altruism.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain's simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>The 'goal' of a machine is simply defined as that state to which it tends to return.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>It leaps from body to body down the generations, manipulating body after body in its own way and for its own ends, abandoning a succession of mortal bodies before they sink in senility and death.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>A gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Human suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp that words are only tools for our use,</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>The universe is populated by stable things.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>(Curiously, peace-time appeals for individuals to make some small sacrifice in the rate at which they increase their standard of living seem to be less effective than war-time appeals for individuals to lay down their lives.)</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chosen examples are never serious evidence for any worthwhile generalization.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Inspiration is for amateurs,” Close says. “The rest of us just show up and get to work.”</p><footer>Daily Rituals How Artists Work (Mason Currey)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Rather than propose a new theory or unearth a new fact, often the most important contribution a scientist can make is to discover a new way of seeing old theories or facts.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anyone can popularize science if he oversimplifies.</p><footer>The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>I believe in getting up from the typewriter, away from it, while I still have things to say.”</p><footer>Daily Rituals How Artists Work (Mason Currey)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Merde! I absolutely detest all openings and parties! They’re commercial, political, and everybody talks too much. They get on my tits!”</p><footer>Daily Rituals How Artists Work (Mason Currey)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>I always wanted to go at the world and try and do too much, and even to do it for something that was not too cheap. That was wrong of me</p><footer>The Trial (Kafka, Franz)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you're under suspicion it better to be moving than still, as if you're still you can be in the pan of the scales without knowing it and be weighed along with your sins."</p><footer>The Trial (Kafka, Franz)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>The pampering of the modern mind has resulted in a population that feels deserving of something without earning that something, a population that feels they have a right to something without sacrificing for it. People declare themselves experts, entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators, mavericks, and coaches without any real-life experience. And they do this not because they actually think they are greater than everybody else; they do it because they feel that they need to be great to be accepted in a world that broadcasts only the extraordinary.</p><footer>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck (Mark Manson)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I used to think the human brain was the most wonderful organ in my body. Then I realized who was telling me this.”</p><footer>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck (Mark Manson)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>It’s easier to sit in a painful certainty that nobody would find you attractive, that nobody appreciates your talents, than to actually test those beliefs and find out for sure.</p><footer>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck (Mark Manson)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Most people need to go to some sort of therapist just to hear these questions asked for the first time.</p><footer>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck (Mark Manson)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Kids were given inane homework assignments, like writing down all the reasons why they thought they were special, or the five things they liked most about themselves.</p><footer>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck (Mark Manson)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Why? My guess: because giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business.</p><footer>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck (Mark Manson)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>should like it to help to open eyes, not to loosen tongues.</p><footer>The Story of Art (Gombrich, E. H.)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>For is it not rather those who misuse 'scientific' language, not to enlighten but to impress the reader, who are 'talking down' to us—from the clouds</p><footer>The Story of Art (Gombrich, E. H.)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>was tired of Miss Montag continuously watching his lips. In that way she took control of what he wanted to say before he said it.</p><footer>The Trial (Kafka, Franz)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>The decisions that democracies make may not demonstrate the wisdom of the crowd. The decision to make them democratically does.</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>What they disagree about is what democracy is for and what we can expect it to accomplish. Do we have it because it gives people a sense of involvement and control over their lives, and therefore contributes to political stability? Do we have it because individuals have the right to rule themselves, even if they use that right in ridiculous ways? Or do we have it because democracy is actually an excellent vehicle for making intelligent decisions and uncovering the truth?</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>“It is far more difficult to form an informed opinion about what is good for society as a whole than it is to determine where one’s self-interest lies,”</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The United States is a tenaciously philistine society,”</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>is that the best way to disclose public information is without hype or even commentary from people in positions of power.</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Companies tend to pay people based on whether they do what they’re expected to do. In a market, people get paid based simply on what they do.</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>One of the real dangers that small groups face is emphasizing consensus over dissent.</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>“In science, one’s private property is established by giving its substance away.”</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>selfish—which is to say they are rational, in the economic sense—and always free ride.</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>People want to do the right thing, but no one wants to be a sucker.</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>The market may not teach people to trust, but it certainly makes it easier for people to do so.</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>what is the free market? It’s a mechanism designed to solve a coordination problem,</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>groups are better at deciding between possible solutions to a problem than they are at coming up with them.</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>trying to find smart people will not lead you astray. Trying to find the smartest person will.</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Its easy to have frends if you let pepul laff at you. Im going to have lots of frends where I go.</p><footer>Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>at night I go out for walks, wander around the city. I don't know why. To see faces, I guess.</p><footer>Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>"There are a lot of people who will give money or materials, but very few who will give time and affection.</p><footer>Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>ago the adolescent in me thought death could happen only to other people),</p><footer>Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>A child may not know how to feed itself, or what to eat, yet it knows hunger.</p><footer>Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>and as soon as exceptional begins to mean anything to anyone they'll change it. The idea seems to be: use an expression only as long as it doesn't mean anything to anybody.</p><footer>Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>He's no Freud or Jung or Pavlov or Watson, but he's doing something important and I respect his dedication—maybe even more because he's just an ordinary man trying to do a great man's work, while the great men are all busy making bombs."</p><footer>Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>It's getting harder for me to write down all my thoughts and feelings because I know that people are reading them.</p><footer>Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Only in the matirnity ward by the babys where it dont matter if she talks too much.</p><footer>Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>“No matter how much evidence exists that seers do not exist, suckers will pay for the existence of seers.”</p><footer>The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Good fences make good neighbors.</p><footer>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master (Hunt, Andrew;Thomas, David)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Everyone knows that they personally are the only good driver on Earth.</p><footer>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master (Hunt, Andrew;Thomas, David)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>All software becomes legacy as soon as it's written.</p><footer>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master (Hunt, Andrew;Thomas, David)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>"It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."</p><footer>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master (Hunt, Andrew;Thomas, David)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Truly amazing, what people can get used to, as long as there are a few compensations.</p><footer>The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Better never means better for everyone,</p><footer>The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>That is what you have to do before you kill, I thought. You have to create an it, where none was before. You do that first, in your head, and then you make it real.</p><footer>The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>How easy it is to invent a humanity, for anyone at all.</p><footer>The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>You can think clearly only with your clothes on.</p><footer>The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>who can remember pain, once it's over?</p><footer>The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>nobody dies from lack of sex, It's lack of love we die from.</p><footer>The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>It's like a fart in church.</p><footer>The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>We lived in the gaps between the stories.</p><footer>The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>What you don't know won't hurt you,</p><footer>The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>There is more than one kind of freedom, said Aunt Lydia.

We've sacrificed the high art. We have the feelies and the scent organ instead."</p><footer>Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>You can't make flivvers without steel-and you can't make tragedies without social instability. The world's stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can't get.</p><footer>Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose-well, you didn't know what the result might be.</p><footer>Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of a mere individual; it strikes at Society itself.</p><footer>Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>"If one's different, one's bound to be lonely.</p><footer>Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>Five minutes later roots and fruits were abolished; the flower of the present rosily blossomed.</p><footer>Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>He hated these things-just because he liked Bernard.</p><footer>Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Myself and nasty.
